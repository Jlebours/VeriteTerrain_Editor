# VeriteTerrain_Editor

The aim of this project is to construct a GroundTruth (VeriteTerrain) and a more successful test suite.

The expected result is not known in advance by a machine. It could be specified for each table on each Wikipedia page but 
there are potentially more than 1000 tables to process. It is time consuming to specify the ground truth.

So, the idea is to develop a tool to be able to graphically specify an expected result.
This tool will be based on the result of one or more extractors that will offer the user a possible result :
it will be to the user to validate this result, to reject or to edit it.
